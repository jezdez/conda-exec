# conda-exec

Ephemeral package execution for conda. Run any conda package without installing it permanently.

```bash
conda exec ruff check .
conda x ruff check .
```

conda-exec creates a cached, isolated environment for the tool, runs it, and exits.
The environment is cached for fast re-use but is not on PATH and is fully disposable.
Think [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx) or
[uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) for the conda ecosystem.

## Install

conda x ruff check .                               # short alias
conda exec --spec "ruff>=0.4" ruff check .          # pin a version
conda exec --with pytest ruff check .               # add extra packages
conda exec -c bioconda samtools view file.bam       # use a different channel
```
