# conda-exec

Ephemeral package execution for conda. Run any conda package without installing it permanently, or run Python scripts with inline dependency metadata.

```bash
conda exec ruff check .
conda exec script.py
```

conda-exec creates a cached, isolated environment, runs the tool or script, and exits.
The environment is cached for fast re-use but is not on PATH and is fully disposable.
Think [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx) or
[uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) for the conda ecosystem.

## Install

## Usage

```bash
conda exec ruff check .                            # run a tool
ce ruff check .                                    # standalone alias
conda exec "ruff>=0.4" check .                     # pin a version
conda exec --with pytest ruff check .              # add extra packages
conda exec -c bioconda samtools view file.bam      # use a different channel
conda exec script.py                               # run a script with inline deps
```
