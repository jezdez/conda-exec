# conda-exec

Ephemeral package execution for conda. Run commands from conda packages
without installing them permanently, or run Python scripts with inline
dependency metadata.

```bash
conda exec ruff check .
conda exec script.py
```

:::

conda-exec creates a cached, isolated environment, runs the tool or script,
and exits. The environment is reused on later runs but is not added to
`PATH` permanently. Think
[npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/commands/npx) or
[uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/), with conda packages and
channels.

## Install

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge conda-exec
```

## Usage

```bash
conda exec ruff check .                            # run a tool
ce ruff check .                                    # standalone alias
conda exec "ruff>=0.4" check .                     # pin a version
conda exec --with pytest ruff check .              # add extra packages
conda exec -c bioconda samtools view file.bam      # use a different channel
conda exec script.py                               # run a script with inline deps
conda exec --lock script.py                        # record a repeatable script env
```
