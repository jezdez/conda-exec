# Quickstart

## Installation

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge conda-exec
```

Install `conda-pypi` as well if you want scripts with top-level PEP 723
`dependencies` from PyPI, and `conda-lockfiles` if you want script lock
support.

## Basic usage

Run a command from a conda package without installing it into your current
environment:

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} conda exec

```bash
conda exec ruff check .
```

:::
:::{tab-item} ce (standalone)

```bash
ce ruff check .
```

:::
::::

The first invocation creates a cached environment. Later runs reuse that
environment and skip the solve/download step.

For more command-line patterns, see [Run command-line tools](how-to/run-tools.md).

## Version constraints

Pin a specific version using a match spec as the tool argument:

```bash
conda exec "ruff>=0.4,<0.5" check .
```

The binary name is extracted from the match spec automatically.

## Extra packages

Add additional packages to the ephemeral environment:

```bash
conda exec --with pytest ruff check .
conda exec --with "python=3.12" jupyter lab
```

## Custom channels

Use packages from other channels:

```bash
conda exec -c bioconda samtools view file.bam
```

## Run scripts

Run a Python script that declares its dependencies inline using
[PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) metadata:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = ["requests", "rich"]
#
# [tool.conda]
# channels = ["conda-forge", "bioconda"]
# dependencies = ["samtools>=1.19"]
# ///

import requests
from rich import print
print("Hello from conda exec!")
```

```bash
conda exec script.py
```

conda-exec parses the inline metadata, creates a cached environment with all
declared dependencies (both conda and PyPI), and runs the script.

```{note}
Scripts with PyPI `dependencies` require [conda-pypi](https://github.com/conda/conda-pypi) to be installed. Conda-only scripts (using only `[tool.conda]` dependencies) work without it.
```

Scripts without metadata run directly with the current Python.

## Lock script environments

Generate lock data when a script should be repeatable across machines or
after cache cleanup:

```bash
conda exec --lock script.py
```

This writes sidecar lock data next to the script. Future normal runs use
the lock data when it matches the script's dependency metadata.

For the step-by-step workflow, see
[Share a locked script](tutorials/share-locked-script.md).
