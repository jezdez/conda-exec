# Error messages

All error conditions raised by conda-exec, with their messages, hints,
and exit codes.

```{tip}
For step-by-step solutions to common problems, see the
[Troubleshooting guide](../how-to/troubleshooting.md).
```

## Exit codes

| Code  | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0     | Success |
| 1     | conda-exec error (solve failure, binary not found, missing dependency, etc.) |
| 2     | Usage error (missing required arguments) |
| 126   | Permission denied when executing the tool binary |
| 127   | Tool binary not found at the expected path |
| Other | Forwarded from the tool's own exit code |

When a tool runs successfully, conda-exec returns whatever exit code
the tool itself returns. The codes 1, 2, 126, and 127 are reserved
for conda-exec's own error conditions.

## Solve and environment errors

### SolveError

Raised when the conda solver cannot resolve the requested packages.

```text
conda exec: failed to solve environment for '<tool>': <detail>
```

The `<detail>` portion contains the solver's own error message,
which typically lists conflicting constraints. Common causes include
version specs that no package satisfies, or conflicting requirements
between `--with` specs.

### InvalidToolMatchSpecError

Raised when the positional tool argument is not a valid conda match spec.

```text
conda exec: invalid match spec for tool '<spec>': <detail>
```

Quote shell-sensitive version constraints and use conda match spec syntax.
For example:

```bash
conda exec "ruff>=0.4,<0.5" check .
```

### SolverNotAvailableError

Raised when no solver backend is available.

```text
conda exec: no conda solver backend is available
  hint: install a solver backend such as conda-libmamba-solver
  hint: or check your 'solver' setting in .condarc
```

### BinaryNotFoundError

Raised when the environment was created successfully but does not
contain an executable matching the tool name.

```text
conda exec: binary '<tool>' not found in cached environment
  hint: the package may not provide a '<tool>' executable
  hint: check the package contents with 'conda search --info <package>'
```

This can happen when the package name differs from the executable it
provides. For example, a package named `python-black` might install a
binary called `black`.

### PyPIDependencyError

Raised in script mode when the script declares top-level `dependencies`
(PyPI packages) but conda-pypi is not installed.

```text
conda exec: script declares PyPI dependencies but conda-pypi is not installed
  hint: install it with: conda install -n base conda-pypi
  hint: or remove the top-level 'dependencies' from the script metadata
```

### PythonVersionError

Raised when a script's `requires-python` constraint cannot be
satisfied by the Python version in the environment.

```text
conda exec: script requires Python <required>, but the environment has <available>
```

### ScriptLockError

Raised when script lock data cannot be generated, embedded, read, or used
to create an environment.

```text
conda exec: script lock error: <detail>
```

Common causes include missing support for conda's registered lockfile
exporter/specifier plugins, lock data larger than the supported size limit,
or using `--lock` on a script without metadata or `--with` specs.

### Script metadata parse error

Raised when a `# /// script` block is malformed, unclosed, or contains
invalid TOML.

```text
conda exec: invalid inline script metadata: <detail>
```

For invalid TOML, `<detail>` starts with `failed to parse TOML:`.

## Execution errors

These errors occur after the environment is ready, when conda-exec
attempts to run the tool binary.

### Command not found (exit 127)

The binary path exists in the cache but the OS cannot find it at
execution time.

```text
conda exec: <name>: command not found
```

### Permission denied (exit 126)

The binary exists but lacks execute permission.

```text
conda exec: <name>: permission denied
```

## Usage errors

### Missing TOOL argument (exit 2)

No tool or script was specified and no mode flag (`--list`, `--clean`)
was given.

```text
conda exec: missing TOOL argument
usage: conda exec [OPTIONS] TOOL [ARGS...]
       conda exec --list
       conda exec --clean
```

### --embed without --lock (exit 2)

`--embed` only changes where generated lock data is written, so it must be
used with `--lock`.

```text
conda exec: --embed requires --lock
```

## Warnings

These are non-fatal messages printed to stderr. They do not affect the
exit code.

### Misplaced --json flag

`--json` was passed without `--list`.

```text
conda exec: warning: --json is only used with --list
```

### Misplaced --dry-run flag

`--dry-run` was passed without `--clean`.

```text
conda exec: warning: --dry-run is only used with --clean
```

### Unusable script lock data

Discovered lock data could not be used, but the script still had metadata
to fall back to.

```text
conda exec: warning: ignoring unusable sidecar lock data: script lock error: <detail>
```

The lock warning can mention `embedded` instead of `sidecar`, depending on
which source was discovered.
