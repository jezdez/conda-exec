# Share a locked script

This tutorial shows how to turn an inline-dependency Python script into a
repeatable artifact with conda-exec lock data.

Use this when a script should keep the same resolved package set after
cache cleanup, on another machine, or in CI.

## Prerequisites

- conda 25.1 or later
- conda-exec installed
- conda-lockfiles installed for the default `rattler-lock-v6` lock format

```bash
conda install -n base -c conda-forge conda-exec conda-lockfiles
```

## Step 1: Write a metadata-backed script

Create `summary.py`:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
#
# [tool.conda]
# channels = ["conda-forge"]
# dependencies = ["python-dateutil"]
# ///

from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.parser import isoparse

started = isoparse("2026-05-28T09:00:00+00:00")
finished = datetime.now(started.tzinfo)
print(f"elapsed seconds: {(finished - started).total_seconds():.0f}")
```

The `# /// script` block records dependency intent. It is meant to stay
small and readable.

## Step 2: Run the script once

```bash
conda exec summary.py
```

On the first run, conda-exec solves the environment and creates a cached
prefix. Later runs reuse the cache as long as the dependency metadata does
not change.

## Step 3: Generate sidecar lock data

Run the script with `--lock`:

```bash
conda exec --lock summary.py
```

conda-exec creates or reuses the environment, exports lock data, writes it
next to the script, and then runs the script.

With the default lock format, the sidecar file is:

```text
summary.py.conda-exec.lock
```

Commit both files when the script is part of a repository:

```text
summary.py
summary.py.conda-exec.lock
```

## Step 4: Run from lock data

Run the script normally:

```bash
conda exec summary.py
```

conda-exec discovers the sidecar lockfile. If the lock digest matches the
current dependency metadata, conda-exec creates the cached environment from
the lock data instead of solving from the metadata.

The cache is still local and disposable. The lockfile is what makes the
environment repeatable after the cache is deleted.

## Step 5: Refresh the lock after changing dependencies

Edit the metadata:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
#
# [tool.conda]
# channels = ["conda-forge"]
# dependencies = ["python-dateutil", "rich"]
# ///
```

Update the lock:

```bash
conda exec --lock --refresh summary.py
```

`--refresh` forces a new environment solve for the changed dependency input.
`--lock` writes fresh lock data for that result.

## Step 6: Embed the lock for a single-file script

Use embedded lock data when the script itself is the artifact you want to
copy around:

```bash
conda exec --lock --embed summary.py
```

conda-exec inserts a generated block:

```python
# /// conda-exec-lock
# # conda-exec-lock-input-sha256: ...
# ...
# ///
```

The dependency metadata remains in the `# /// script` block. The embedded
lock block is generated state and should be refreshed with conda-exec.

## Step 7: Ignore the lock for a diagnostic run

Use `--ignore-lock` when you want to test whether the metadata still solves
without using lock data:

```bash
conda exec --ignore-lock summary.py
```

This does not modify the sidecar or embedded lock. It only changes the
current run.

## What happened?

You now have three layers:

1. Script metadata describes what the script needs.
2. Lock data records one concrete resolution of those needs.
3. The local cache stores a disposable environment created from metadata or
   lock data.

That separation is the script workflow: readable dependency intent,
optional reproducibility, and local cache reuse.
