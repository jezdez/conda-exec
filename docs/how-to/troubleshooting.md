# Troubleshoot common issues

```{tip}
Most cache-related problems are fixed by running `conda exec --refresh TOOL ...`,
which discards the cached environment and creates a fresh one. Try this first
before deeper debugging.
```

## "command not found" after install

If `conda exec` is not recognized after installing conda-exec, the plugin
may not be loaded. Verify the installation:

```bash
conda list -n base conda-exec
```

If it is installed but still not found, check that `conda-rattler-solver`
is also installed. conda-exec requires it:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-rattler-solver
```

The standalone `ce` command should work independently of the plugin system.
If `conda exec` fails but `ce` works, the plugin entry point is not being
discovered. Reinstalling conda-exec usually fixes this:

```bash
conda install -n base --force-reinstall conda-exec
```

## "solver not available" error

```text
conda exec: conda-rattler-solver is required but not installed
```

Install the solver backend:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-rattler-solver
```

## "binary not found" error

```text
conda exec: binary 'foo' not found in cached environment
```

The package was installed, but it does not provide a binary matching the
package name. This happens when the package name differs from the
executable name.

Inspect what the package actually provides:

```bash
conda exec --list
```

Check the package contents to find the correct binary name:

```bash
conda search --info foo
```

## "conda-pypi required" error

```text
conda exec: script declares PyPI dependencies but conda-pypi is not installed
```

Your script has a top-level `dependencies` field (PyPI packages) in its
PEP 723 metadata, but conda-pypi is not available. Install it:

```bash
conda install -n base conda-pypi
```

Alternatively, move your dependencies to `[tool.conda].dependencies` if
they are available as conda packages, which does not require conda-pypi.

## Slow first run

The first invocation of a tool is slow because conda-exec must:

1. Resolve dependencies using the solver
2. Download packages
3. Extract and install them into the cached environment

Subsequent runs reuse the cache and start instantly. To see existing
cached environments:

```bash
conda exec --list
```

## Cache corruption

If a cached environment is broken (e.g., from an interrupted download or
disk issue), force re-creation:

```bash
conda exec --refresh ruff check .
```

To remove all cached environments and start fresh:

```bash
conda exec --clean --all --yes
```

## Permission denied (exit code 126)

```text
conda exec: ruff: permission denied
```

```{warning}
Re-creating an environment with `--refresh` removes any manual
customizations made to that cached environment. If you have added files
or modified the environment by hand, back them up first.
```

The binary exists but is not executable. This can happen if the cached
environment was copied from another system or if file permissions were
altered. Fix it by re-creating the environment:

```bash
conda exec --refresh ruff check .
```

## Tool not found (exit code 127)

```text
conda exec: ruff: command not found
```

The binary could not be executed. This typically means the executable was
deleted from the cached environment or there is a platform mismatch.
Re-create the environment:

```bash
conda exec --refresh ruff check .
```

If the problem persists, clean the cache entirely:

```bash
conda exec --clean --all --yes
conda exec ruff check .
```
