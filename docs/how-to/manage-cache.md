# Manage the cache

conda-exec caches environments for fast re-use. Over time, these caches can accumulate.

## List cached environments

```bash
conda exec list
```

Shows all cached environments with their size, last-used timestamp, and package count.

## Clean old caches

Remove environments not used in 30 days:

```bash
conda exec clean
```

Preview what would be removed:

```bash
conda exec clean --dry-run
```

Remove all caches:

```bash
conda exec clean --all
```

Remove caches for a specific tool:

```bash
conda exec clean ruff
```

## Force re-creation

If a cached environment is stale or broken, force re-creation:

```bash
conda exec --refresh ruff check .
```
